- Decompress it.
- Run with: `node index --install`

### Understanding

Lets understand Blongular's directory:

```
/blogs/					Directory where you put all your blongular blogs
/blongular/				Blongular core directory
config.json				Blongular server configuration
```

The rest you should ignore.

Now, let's understand the structure of a blog:

```
/controllers/			Directory where the controller engine goes.
/editor/				Directory where the editor engine goes.
/themes/				Directory where you should put your themes folders
blongular.json			Blog's configuration
components.json			Blog's database and plugin configuration
```

### Configuring

##### Blog Singular Configuration

Inside your blog directory you will find two files for your blog configuration:

- blongular.js (blog configuration)
- components.js (database/plugins configuration)

##### Server configuration (config.json)

This configuration is for all blogs running inside your Blongular's directory.
